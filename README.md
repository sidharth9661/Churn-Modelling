Checked for missing values in the data, check for outliers, missing value treatment, analysis by Gender, Marital Status, occupation, purchase by city, etc.  Performed Univariate, bivariate analysis and multivariate analysis.
Churn Modelling: Data Analysis and Visualization
This is a data analysis and visualization project that explores customer churn in a bank. The project uses Python and SQL to analyze the dataset and perform various analysis such as univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.

# Getting Started
To explore the data analysis and visualizations, simply open the Jupyter notebook file in your web browser or preferred development environment. The notebook contains all of the code used to analyze the dataset and create the visualizations.

# Dataset
The Churn Modelling dataset contains information about customers of a bank, including their demographics, account information, and transaction history. The dataset also includes a binary variable indicating whether or not the customer has churned.

# Analysis
The analysis in this project focuses on identifying the factors that contribute to customer churn. The analysis uses Python and SQL to clean and preprocess the data, and to identify trends and patterns in the dataset.

The analysis found that the main factors contributing to customer churn were low account balance, being female, and being single. The analysis also found that occupation and transaction history were not significant factors in customer churn.

# Visualization
The visualizations in this project use Python's matplotlib and seaborn libraries to create charts and graphs that represent the data in a more interesting and engaging way. The visualizations include histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots that allow users to explore the data and identify trends and patterns.

The visualizations highlight the factors that contribute to customer churn, and provide insight into the demographics and account information of customers who have churned.

# Acknowledgements
This project was inspired by the need to understand and prevent customer churn in a bank. Special thanks to the developers of Python and SQL for providing the tools necessary to analyze the data, and to the matplotlib and seaborn libraries for creating visually appealing charts and graphs.
